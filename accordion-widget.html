<button class="accordion">I don't remember my password.</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When logging in, click "Forgot your password?" You should receive a password reset email withing a few minutes with instructions to reset your password. For security reasons, we cannot view or retrieve your previous password. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If you do not receive the reset email, check your spam or junk folder and verify that you are using the correct email associated with your account. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If you still need assistance, contact your district representative or email <a href="mailto: support@aealearningonline.org">support@aealearningonline.org</a>.

<br>
<button class="accordion">My account has an old email and I can't access it anymore to reset my password. How do I change the email? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    You should reach out to your district contact first. If that is not possible, you can submit a support ticket by going <a href="https://training.aealearningonline.org/help-ticket">here</a> or by emailing <a href="mailto: support@aealearningonline.org">support@aealearningonline.org</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Provide as much detail as possible (i.e. First Name, Last Name, previous Last Name if you have had a name change, BoEE folder number if known, prior emails if known). The more information you provide, the quicker we are able to support.
  </p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<button class="accordion">When I tried making a new account it said my email or BoEE number was already in use.</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>This means you already have an account in the system and <strong>you should NOT make a new one</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Do NOT just click the N/A box for your BoEE number or put in a different email and create a new account. We can merge accounts later. However, this may cause you to lose your original course/training completion history. We are not held responsible if your training history is not present after an account merge. 
    <br>

    If you do not remember what email you might have used on your account, email <a href="mailto: support@aealearningonline.org">support@aealearningonline.org</a>.
